This repo is about large labeled dataset of Twitter text, which has been labeled according to the sentiment orientation of the text. With 1.6 million tweets, this dataset presents a challenge in terms of extracting actionable insights, and the nature of the problem will be more focused on social media analysis from both a sentiment and topic perspective. To begin, I will clean and preprocess the data to make it easier to apply statistical analysis. From there, I will conduct topic modeling of the corpus, followed by sentiment analysis for different topics. By doing this analysis, I aim to uncover insights that can be derived from the data.
The notebook will be structured as follows:
• Data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing • Topic modeling
• Sentiment analysis classifier
• Sentiment analysis for different topics
• Sentiment analysis for the whole corpus.
• Conclusion, discussion, and business insights
